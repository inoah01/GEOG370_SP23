    <h1>Homework 6: Michigan Census Data Choropleth</h1>
    <p>Below, is my choropleth map of Michigan counties and Census data. More specifically, this <br>
    map looks at the median household income (in 2021-adjusted USD) for families across Michigan counties.<br>
    The U.S. Census defines a family as, ". . . a group of two people or more (one of whom is the householder)<br> 
    related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together . . .". There was not any particular reasoning <br>
    behind me choosing to look at income and families aside from the fact that I thought those would be <br>
    broad enough to show change across Michigan. There was, however, a particular reason in me choosing <br>
    symbology that I chose. Green is a color that is commonly associated with nature or money. In this <br>
    case, it is not variation in nature that is being studied, but rather income (money).</p>
