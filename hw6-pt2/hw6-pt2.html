    <h1>Homework 6 Part 2</h1>
    <p>Below are my three choropleth maps of Michigan counties looking at the median household income <br>
    to median with cash rent ratio. In order to calculate this ratio, I first had to revisit my data from <br>
    homework 6 part 1 and get the column for household income as opposed to family household income. The other <br>
    key part of this ratio was rental data. I obtained this data through the same census data source as the <br>
    median income data. After following a similar procedure for cleaning the data, I joined the two new columns to <br>
    the Michigan counties vector layer that I had made for homework 6 part 1.</p>
    <p>
        I chose median household income to median with cash rent ratio to look at relative housing affordability in <br>
        Michigan counties. Though the method of classification varies between the maps below, one fact <br>
        remains constant, a higher ration indicates a higher cost of living. What makes further interpreting these <br>
        results difficult, is correctly choosing the right classification method. Some ratios were hardly above 2, <br>
        while others were greater than 10. This variation in values means that choosing an inappropriate classification <br>
        method could result in missed outliers and patterns, or in the context of the ratio, incorrectly assuming interpreting <br>
        the cost of living of a particular county. The three different classification modes I chose to compare are Equal Counts,<br>
        Logarithmic Scale, and Pretty Breaks. Please click on the respective map for more information on the classification mode.
