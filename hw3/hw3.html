    <h1>Homework 3</h1>
    <h2>Projection #1: Cylindrical Equal Area</h2>
    <p>
      For my first projection, I decided to use the Cylindrical Equal Area
      projection <br />
      According to ArcGIS, this rectangular projection originates from a Swiss
      mathematician named <br />
      John H. Lambert and was first mentioned in 1772. Looking at the projection
      with <br />
      Tissot's indicatrix applied, we can see that this projection does a pretty
      decent <br />
      job at preserving space, direction, and area, but distorts the shape
      pretty badly <br />
      as you approach the +/- 30-90* latitudes. This increasing distortion
      towards the <br />
      poles supports the claim on ArcGIS that this projection is best used for
      <br />
      large-scale maps closer to the equator.

        width="500px"
      />
    </a>
    <h2>Projection #2: Aitoff</h2>
    <p>
      For my second projection, I decided to use the Aitoff projection. ArcGIS
      mentions <br />
      the Aitoff projection is a "modified azimuthal projection". The ArcGIS
      article also <br />
      mentions that this projection was "developed by Russian cartographer David
      A. Aitoff <br />
      in 1889." Tissot's indicatrix demonstrates that this projection distorts
      shape, area, <br />
      and direction to some extent. Most obviously, the projection distorts the
      direction <br />
      and area as you deviate away from the Prime Meridian. Based on this, it
      would seem that <br />
      this projection is used for much smaller-scale maps than the Cylindrical
      Equal Area projection <br />
      and the Gall Stereographic projection.

        width="500px"
      />
    </a>
    <h2>Projection #3: Gall Stereographic</h2>
    <p>
      For my third and final projection, I decided to use the Gall Stereographic
      Projection. The <br />
      Gall Stereographic projection is another rectangular projection and
      according to ArcGIS, was <br />
      created by James Gall in 1855. With Tissot's indicatrix, we can see that
      the distortion of the Gall <br />
      Stereographic projection is similar to that of the Cylindrical Equal Area
      projection. Since they are both <br />
      types of cylindrical projections, they both experience the same increasing
      distortion as you approach <br />
      the poles. The biggest difference between the two projections is that it
      appears the Gall Stereographic <br />
      does a better job preserving shape as you approach the poles. Like the
      Cylindrical Equal Area projection, <br />
      this projection would be best for large-scale maps with a focus closer to
      the equator than the poles.
